<h1 class="text-green-700 py-4"> 1 - Spider Plant </h1>
Spider plants, or Chlorophytum comosum, are extremely easy to grow, don’t require constant attention and thrive with little investment on your behalf. The plants have narrow leaves and get their name from the “small plantlets produced on long trailing stems that vaguely resemble spiders,” according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension. Spider plants are known to help purify the surrounding air. NASA research examined the leaves, soil, roots and microorganisms of several houseplants and found that plants can act as a natural air filter to reduce pollutants. The study indicates that spider plants removed 95% of toxic formaldehyde from the air in a sealed Plexiglas container over a 24-hour period.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 2 - Peace Lily </h1>
The name “peace lily” definitely evokes a sense of calm. These sturdy plants also “flower and are aesthetically pleasing” and may benefit your health over time, explains Trevor Cates, N.D, a naturopathic doctor in Park City, Utah, and author of Clean Skin From Within. A 2022 study published in Applied Sciences suggests that peace lilies have air-cleaning properties and help to remove carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air. Peace lilies can live for years and continuously produce broad white flowers that resemble a white peace flag, per materials published by MiracleGro. They’re easy to take care of and don’t need much light, so they’re perfect for shady spaces. Just keep them out of reach from pets and small children, as they can cause vomiting or tongue swelling if they’re ingested.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 3 - Rubber Plants </h1>
Rubber plants — also known as rubber trees or Ficus elastica — make for great indoor houseplants. They’re generally easy to take care of and only need to be watered every week or so, according to materials shared by The Sill. Research shows that rubber plants feature air-purifying properties. Just be sure to keep them firmly away from any pets and from young children, as they're known to be highly toxic when ingested.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 4 - Elephant Ear Plants </h1>
If you want to spend a little more time with your houseplants, Cromer recommends elephant ear plants. These are organized into a group of tropical, perennial plants instantly recognizable by their big, heart-shaped leaves. They need bright light and regular watering to keep the soil moist, and they can get big and may need extra space. Some species have been grown for their edible starchy tubers, which are a food staple in certain tropical regions. Medicinally, the leaves have been noted for their use in treating insect stings.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 5 - Snake Plants </h1>
Long known as “mother-in-law’s tongues,” the snake plant, or Sansevieria trifasciata, features tall leaves that grow vertically. They’re decorative and extremely low-maintenance. The plants only need to be watered when the soil is dry, grow in any kind of light, and generally “thrive on neglect,” according to experts at HGTV. The snake plant was included in the same sweeping NASA study of indoor plants, and has been shown to remove toxins from the air over time.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 6 - Ferns </h1>
A 2022 study published in Applied Sciences showed that Boston ferns performed best when it comes to air cleaning by naturally VOCs from the air. The plants grow easily and look the best indoors in hanging baskets or on plant stands, which allow their fronds to drape. They need medium bright light and consistently moist soil, so they might require a bit more of your time.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 7 - Pothos </h1>
When you picture a houseplant, the pothos, or Epipremnum pinnatum, is likely what comes to mind. Also known as devil’s ivy or golden pothos, the plants feature vibrant heart-shaped leaves that may be green or marbled green and yellow. They’re easy to grow, needing only indirect sunlight and infrequent watering. Research shows that the plants can lower indoor ozone levels, which can make it easier to breathe and reduce your risk for respiratory ailments, as well as remove VOCs from the air.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 8 - English Ivy </h1>
English ivy, or Hedera helix, is a versatile plant that’s been shown to lower levels of carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, and toxins in the air. They can be grown outside or indoors. As a houseplant, the ivy grows well in hanging baskets or pots, and can be trained to grow along a trellis or shape, according to the Clemson University Cooperative Extension. They grow best in direct sunlight and need to be watered thoroughly once the soil dries out.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 9 - Succulents and Cacti </h1>
Succulents and cacti “thrive on little to no care,” Cromer says. These plants are drought-resistant, meaning they don’t need regular watering; only just when the soil is completely dry. They also come in many shapes and sizes to decorate your space and can help clean the air. Some varieties, including the jade plant, can increase humidity in a room. Aloe vera plants, in particular, also have medicinal properties and can help heal cuts, burns, and other skin ailments.

<h1 class="text-green-700 py-5"> 10 - Herbs </h1>
Small potted herbs not only look cute in your kitchen, but they may also inspire you to cook more often and eat healthier. Growing your own basil, parsley, or mint is also cheaper than purchasing herbs from the grocery store. Several herbs, like chamomile and lavender, have been shown to reduce anxiety, per Mayo Clinic officials. Herbs also contain vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which are a boon for your dietary routine.
