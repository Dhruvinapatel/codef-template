You should get a plant that can survive your house’s lighting and temperature and is easy to maintain as well as budget-friendly.

Michael Leach, a houseplant expert, says you should not get plants the way you buy furniture; you should understand that each plant has unique needs and might not suit your house’s environment.

Thinking about getting a plant is almost comparable to when you wonder, “What pet should I get?” It could get complicated and stressful.

With the right questions, though, you can determine the best species for your home—almost like an expert. And that’s when the houseplant quiz comes into play.
